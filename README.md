# fillit

Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to
assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.

Your program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them
in order to create the smallest square possible.Main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time.

A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.

Your executable must take only one parameter, a file which contains a list of Tetriminos
to assemble.(called tetramino.txt as example in project folder)

How to use:

1. make
2. ./fillit tetramino.txt
